        <h3>Design and Development of Software and Industrial Network Solutions</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code when I was in University in 2004 in PC running MS-Dos or Windows 98.
           I wanted to make my own computer games in C. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experiences 
           designing and developing applications of industrial automation systems, testing and commissioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          During university days I handled computer networks for our hostel facilities consisting of about
          300 nodes. I was responsible for managing managed switches, hardware firewalls and linux based servers
          to provide various services. I did this for more than 3 years.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Later, during professional stint in Yokogawa at Abu Dhabi, I worked in various projects involving design
          implementation,testing, troubleshooting industrial networks and firewalls for large refineries and
          upstream oil and gas installations.
        </p>

        <h3>Additional Skills</h3>
        <p>But my best skill is actually in analyzing and figuring out the best solution for a problem 
          without limiting to just proprietary programming. I love automating the known to explore 
          unknowns. I have developed skills in full stack web development and mobile app development 
          along with machine learning with python for data analytics. Try me to provide customised super useful 
          solutions for SMEs.
